One tailed t test(right) to check that difference mean > 0
H0 : Difference mean = 0.
H1 : Difference mean  > 0.
Assuming H0 is true,t statistic : 5.10990443330401
Suppose the level of significance is 5%, Degrees of freedom=99
Therefore, for right tailed t test, Critical value for the boundary of critical region : 1.984217
If t statistic > 1.984217, there is enough evidence to reject H0
There is enough evidence to reject H0. Therefore the difference mean > 0.
So, misplaced tiles heuristics need more number of steps than manhattan distance heuristics. Therefore the manhattan distance heuristic is better.

H0 : Difference mean = 0.
H1 : Difference mean  < 0.
Assuming H0 is true,t statistic : 5.10990443330401
Suppose the level of significance is 5%, Degrees of freedom=99
Therefore, for right tailed t test, Critical value for the boundary of critical region : -1.984217
If t statistic > -1.984217, there is enough evidence to reject H0
There is not enough evidence to reject H0. Therefore there is not enough evidence to state difference mean < 0. SO, there is not enough evidence to state misplaced tiles heuristic is better than the manhattan distance heuristic.
